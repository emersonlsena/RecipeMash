<h1>Privacy Policy for Recipe Mash</h1>
<small>Last updated: October 28, 2025</small>

<p>Recipe Mash ("we", "our", "the app") helps you generate cooking ideas from the ingredients you already have. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p><strong>Ingredients / text you type in.</strong> When you type ingredients or other prompts, we send that text to our backend service so we can generate recipes for you.</p>

<p><strong>Favorites you save.</strong> When you save a recipe as a favorite, it is stored locally on your device so you can view it later.</p>

<p><strong>Basic technical data.</strong> When the app talks to our backend, we may receive basic technical information such as IP address, device/platform type, and timestamp. We use this to operate the service and prevent abuse.</p>

<p>We do not request your name, phone number, precise location, contacts, photos, or microphone/audio.</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To generate recipes and cooking steps from the ingredients you enter</li>
  <li>To display example food images (illustrative only)</li>
  <li>To improve reliability, debug issues, and prevent abuse</li>
  <li>To show in-app advertising</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>

<p><strong>On your device.</strong> Favorites and saved recipes are stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the app, that data is removed from your device.</p>

<p><strong>Our servers / AI providers.</strong> When you ask for recipes, your ingredient list is sent to our backend. Our backend forwards the request to a generative AI service (for example, Google Gemini / similar large language model), gets recipe suggestions, and sends them back to you.</p>

<p>Because we use third-party AI services and ad networks, some information (like text you typed, or general device/ad info) may be shared with those providers so the core features and ads can work. Each provider processes data under its own privacy policy.</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Advertising</h2>

<p>Recipe Mash may display ads. Advertising partners may receive device-level signals (for example an advertising ID, basic device/platform info, approximate region, and ad interaction data) to show and measure ads. We do not knowingly use sensitive categories (e.g. health status, religion) to serve ads.</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>Recipe Mash is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, contact us at support@updaterzone.com and we will delete it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>6. Your Choices</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can remove items from Favorites in the app. This deletes them from your device.</li>
  <li>You can uninstall the app at any time. This deletes locally stored data such as favorites.</li>
  <li>You may contact us at support@updaterzone.com and request removal of server-side logs associated with your requests where reasonably possible.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>7. Security</h2>

<p>We use reasonable technical safeguards, like HTTPS, to protect data in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<hr />

<h2>8. International Use</h2>

<p>Our services may be hosted in the United States or other regions. By using the app, you understand that your information may be processed and stored in a country different from your own, which may have different data protection laws.</p>

<hr />

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>

<hr />
